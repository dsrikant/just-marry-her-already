In a world where it is becoming increasingly stupider and stupider to give up
one's last name in the name of marriage, we give you "just_marry _her_Already."

Our service generates a cryptographically secure last name for your new family
using the ssn of each partner in the relationship as a private key.

Once a last name ahs been genrated, future generations can recover the maiden
names of both of their parents with their private ssn keys and their own last names
